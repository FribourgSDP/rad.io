<p>Concerning points rewards, binary system prefered by TA.<br>
If a API is used for extracting/getting audio sample, we should check the policy.<br>
2 part of offline:<br>

Idea for what is on the cloud and what is not: have a local and remote playlist: the user has to choose what playlist is on the cloud and what is on the phone.<br>
Small room of about 8 people. The goal is to for everyone to be able to sing at one point. This would not be possible in big room. <br>
